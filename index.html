              Dawoodiyya is a dervish order. It is based on Islam, as dervish orders are, and maintains the pillars of belief: belief in one God, angels, prophets, revealed books, the resurrection, and divine decree. It also maintains the pillars of practice: confession of one God, prayer, fasting, alms, and pilgrimage to the house of God in Makkah. Like other orders, it has a chain of transmission, a spiritual discipline under the guidance of a shaykh, and a core of handed-down oral traditions. It encourages its members to adhere to the principles and practices of early Islam, those of the salaf, and expressed in the various schools of jurisprudence. There is a strong focus on Tawheed, the divine oneness.

              The order is organized as pairs of individuals, musahip, who work together to bring blessing into the world through the recitation of Scripture. This follows the example of David and Jonathan. They ordinarily take the hand of one of the Dawoodi shuyukh, who guides them individually in the discipline. The living transmitter of the tradition is generally seen as the head of the order, but the order is not hierarchical. The use of Scriptural recitation is coupled with begging the four occulted ones with tears to be admitted into their communion and companionship. A unique feature of the order is the written dhikr. Adherents are encouraged to keep a notebook in which they have copied passages of Scripture.

              The core traditions, in addition to the chain of transmission, are set out in groups of four to make it easy to remember them.
            </div>

            <div>
              The Four Books: Taurat, Zabur, Injil, and Qurˀan, that is, the Bible and the Qurˀan.

            <div>
              The Four Gates: Shariat (divine law), Tariqat (the dervish way), Maˀrifat (awareness), and Haqiqat (reality).
            </div>

            <div>

              Most Dervish orders have a set day of the week for dhikr or sema in a group, and Dawoodiyya is no exception. The day of sema is the time generally referred to as Friday evening or Saturday, that is, the Islamic day of Sabt. The sema includes recitation of the names of Allah and aqeedah or the creed, the ten commandments, Psalms, and other passages from the Four Books, that is, the Bible and Qurˀan. Recitation may be in the original languages or in the vernacular or in the English translation of The Beloved and I. The recitation may be accompanied with sacred circle dance.

              While adherence to an Islamic madhab is highly expected, especially in Islamic countries, the practice of David may also be followed, such as fasting every other day, two additional daily prayers, and particular regard for the Sabbath of the commandment with duha or mid-morning prayers following the sunna of the Prophet and the four rightly guided caliphs.
            </div>

            <div>
              While some independent or lone dervishes may follow Dawoodi practice, it is best to take the hand of the living transmitter of the tradition or one of his or her deputies. A great deal of oral tradition helpful in spiritual life can be had from these people, tailored to the needs of each individual. There are representatives of the order in various places around the world, in Europe, Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey. The Dervish Order of Dawoodiyya is presently transmitted by Shaykh Ahmed of Vlorë, Albania.
