            <h2>
              Chapter One: The Garden
            </h2>

            <div>
              I am fortunate to live in a part of the city
              that shelters a beautiful park. The park is a
              garden, strangely secluded in a swirl of
              traffic. I spend some time walking there on
              most days since its main gate is hardly forty
              steps from my own door. The name of the
              garden, Namaz, is set in a bronze plaque in a
              stone and masonry wall at the gate, which
              opens onto a place of remarkable peace. I
              have often wondered how, in a city of this
              size, so few people have discovered its
              winding, peaceful paths.
            </div>

            <div>
              Generally I am alone in the heavy scent of
              herbs seduced by the heat of the sun. Even
              the crisp morning air in the place is fragrant.
              Occasionally lovers can be seen at a distance
              towards evening. But mostly I am alone.
              The privacy of the garden is a wonder for
              another reason. It seems to have been caught
              on a corner of time, so that the cycles of
              years pass it by. The winter ice at the gate is
              overcast by a blossoming bough and fruits
              found in no other place are always in season.
              Yet so few people stop to enjoy them, that the
              ground under the trees is thick with the
              pungent odors of ripeness and rotting.
              There is indeed a gardener with whom I
              have on rare occasions stopped to chat, but I
              usually pass him with a nod and the briefest
              of greetings. He is often so rapt in his work,
              which he seems to do more for the enjoyment
              of it than for his salary, that he hardly seems
              to see me as I pass.
            </div>

            <div>
              He surprised me this afternoon as I was
              engrossed in sampling one of the fruits that
              was just coming on. It is one I look forward
              to throughout the year, as it is available for
              only a few short days. I do not know its
              name, but have heard it to be of the genus
              Ramadhan. It is slightly smaller than a plum,
              of a translucent golden color with a blush of
              crimson. It is still quite hard when ripe, but
              very tart to the tongue. The unusual thing
              about it is the delightful smell of vanilla from
              the skin. After having eaten one, the smell
              stays on one's fingers for hours and no
              washing seems to diminish it.
            </div>

            <div>
              As I was enjoying one of these delicacies
              and already eying another, I was startled at
              the approach of the gardener. Now all of the
              fruits in the garden are open to the public to
              enjoy merely on condition that none are
              removed from the premises. But the seclusion
              of the place inspires a sense of intruding on
              private property, and the property of a
              wealthy and powerful personage at that. So I
              looked up guiltily from my pleasurable task.
              Overlooking my embarrassment, the
              gardener paused to comment on the condition
              of the bushes. Then he abruptly turned to me
              and asked, "Have you ever visited the
              fountain on the eastern slope of the garden?"
              I was astonished. I had imagined that with
              all of my years of frequenting the place, I had
              discovered all there was to know about it.
              Suddenly I realized that, although the garden
              did not seem large, it held secrets of which I
              had been completely unaware. I had in fact
              spent years wandering over the same paths by
              force of habit, and all of my intimate
              knowledge of the garden was little more than
              mere illusion. At once a new boldness took
              hold on me and I answered, "No, sir, I did not
              even realize that the fountain existed. Would
              you be so kind as to lead me there?"
              "With pleasure," he said, and with that led
              me down the pathway.
            </div>

            <div>
              We had not walked more than a few
              minutes when we came out of the shade of
              the trees into a bright glade. Against the
              hillside there was a sun-engulfed fountain
              that seemed to be bubbling out liquid
              diamonds. I stopped short and stared at the
              scene, amazed that such a place existed at my
              very fingertips for so long without my
              knowing of it. The gardener turned to go. "I
              hope you enjoy it," he said and then retraced
              his steps back to his labors.
            </div>

            <div>
              I had already been admiring the beauties of
              the fountain for several minutes before I
              noticed a man sitting on the grass behind it.
              He wore a dark beard and was fingering a
              string of white and rare green onyx beads.
              The glint of the sun on his beads was what
              had attracted my attention.
              When the man noticed that I had seen him,
              he got up, produced a green onyx bowl, filled
              it with the clear liquid of the well, and
              brought it to me, saying at the same time,
              "Peace to you."
            </div>

            <div>
              "And to you also peace," I replied. When I
              had tasted the drink I was amazed. For it was
              sweeter than honey, more refreshing than
              nectar of limes, and in some way more
              intoxicating than the finest wine. Yet the
              draught seemed to make my mind and senses
              clearer, so that the shadows about me
              disappeared and every leaf stood out in bold
              relief like so many living emeralds.
              "What is this well and why have I not
              found it sooner?" I asked the man.
              This is an ancient well, dug by the early
              prophets. Beside it sat one day the great
              prophet and Messiah, peace be upon him. He
              was very thirsty, and at that time the well was
              deep. A woman came to draw water and he
              asked her for a drink. Since that time the well
              has been full and running over, a fountain of
              living water that if anyone drinks of it, he
              will never again be thirsty. But it is true that
              few find it. If they search at all, they search
              too far away, not realizing that the fountain of
              living water is within the garden."
            </div>

            <div>
              "And who are you, sir?" I asked somewhat
              discourteously I fear. I had the feeling that he
              not only knew who I was but the mere
              suggestion there might be anything he did not
              know was foolish.
              "I am the gate into the city," he said and
              took a golden key on a silver chain and
              opened a door in the hillside. As soon as he
              had opened the door and was standing beside
              it, it seemed to me that he turned into a great
              lion with a shining mane. When I saw the
              lion in front of the door my legs refused to
              support me and I fell to the ground fainting.
              Everything turned dark.
            </div>

            <div>
              When I looked about me again, there was
              neither lion nor man, but only the fountain,
              the onyx beads on the grass, and before me
              an open door and a golden staircase.
